### Getting Started

Using the AudioTools library is easy

* Add the AudioTools [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AudioTools) to your project (which must target at least .Net 6). 
* For Class-libraries or console apps: Make sure you use the Windows version of your Target Framework (at least .Net 6):    

    ```<XML>
    <PropertyGroup>
    ...
    <TargetFramework>net6.0-windows</TargetFramework>
    ...
    </PropertyGroup>
    ```

* Start using the Audiotools classes...
